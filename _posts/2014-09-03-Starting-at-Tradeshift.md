After almost 8 years at Schantz, i thought it was time for something new. So after a couple of nice talks with the Tradeshift CTO Gert Sylvest, I've decided to join Tradeshift.

I'm starting this week at a new company with a new domain, so i guess i'll be very busy. My guess is that most of the week will be spent on setting up the computer, and learn the new organisation and domain.

I'm really looking forward to meet my new colleagues, and to learn something new.

There will be a new post of friday with a recap of the week, hopefully i will have coded something in the new domain by then :)
